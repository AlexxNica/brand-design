# Logos.

All the dotmesh logos in various formats. Please read the below for more information about formats and choosing the right logo.

## File formats.

1. EPS: For print only. Vector format logos
2. PNG: For digital and web use only.
3. SVG: Flexible use.

## Colour space.

1. CMYK: For standard printed documents that print using four colour plates (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key).
2. RGB: For screen and digital use.
3. Pantone: For printing when we wish to use a Neon colour version of the logo (as CMYK doesn't have a wide enough Gamut to produce neon)

## Positive and negative versions.

We have different versions of the logo depending on which background type they are to be used upon.
Other than for contrast, negative versions have been optimised by increasing negative space, and thinning text to counter-act the visual illusion of thickening, when appearing on a dark background.

* For logos on a light coloured background, use files that contain the word 'positive' in the name.
* For logos on a dark coloured background, use files that contain the word 'negative' in the name.

## For use at small size.

If you wish to use the logo at a size smaller than:

* 10mm in height (print)
* 25px in height (web and digital)

and you wish to place on a light coloured background, please use the files that contain 'small' in their name.

_Note:_: Negative styles don't require a unique small version.
